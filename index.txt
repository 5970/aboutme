Akhil

I am a new member of the Spring Batch working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science. I will be completing my masters in 2020.

I’m from Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana and I recently move to Maryville to get graduated in Applied Computer Science from Northwest Missouri State University. I’m a fresher and completed my Bachelor’s in 2018 from Gandhi Institute of Technology And Management University in Electronics and Communication Engineering. After completion of masters I started interning about Android Programming in developing a product named “Smart Highway”, the main theme of this app is entertainment on wheels as we mostly find them on airlines.

It’s my dream to work in Apple after watching the release of iphone 3G the thing I liked the most is the software(IOS) which is more secured. I want to enrich my technical skills, programming skills and get placed as a Software developer in Apple. After getting known about the course curriculum of Applied Computer Science I was very excited about the subjects and I am pretty sure with these concepts i will be rich in both theoretical and practical knowledge eventually   helps me in advancing my career in Apple.

Thank You.
